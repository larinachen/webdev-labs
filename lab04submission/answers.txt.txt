What is the value of SQL Alchemy?
- SQL Alchemy simplifies how we communicate with various SQL databases via abstractions. 
  Instead of writing SQL commands directly, developers write python-like commands to interact with the database.
  This enables us to use the same commands across many different SQL databases.


What is a model?
- A model emulates the structure of a table in the database and provides objects that translate ("map") the commands 
  that the developer can use to interact with the database.


What is a view?
- We can regard view as the client of model. It has more "upper-level" commands that the developer can use to interact 
  with the database (e.g. post, delete, etc.)
